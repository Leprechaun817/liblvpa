LVPA -- Lost Vikings Project Archive

Originally written for https://github.com/fgenesis/lv3proj
- hence the name.

----------[ About ]------------

LVPA is a library and container file format optimized for games.
It features a few compression algorithms to choose from,
optional 2-stage data encryption, multiple solid blocks for coherent
data for better compression and faster loading,
and is best suited for static/pre-generated data containers.

A command line packer/unpacker (lvpak) is included.
It can deal with listfiles, which allow to specify packing settings down to each single file.
See lvpak.txt for more documentation about it.

Bindings for ttvfs (https://github.com/fgenesis/ttvfs) are included,
which allows to merge files on disk and inside LVPA containers transparently,
in a way that the embedding application does not have to care where to load its data from.

As a special feature for data safety it is possible to create
encrypted LVPA containers that can be read normally by the embedding application,
but that are not possible to extract even if the encryption key is known.
(Not by normal means, at least. "Scrambled" files are considerably
harder to unpack than just encrypted files, as long as the file names
are known only to those who created the container.)
As encryption an ARC4 variant is used, that is about 3-4x faster than the original,
and should be more secure (however, i can't proof this mathematically, sorry :) -
- if you can, drop me a mail!). Hashing is done with SHA256.
By changing a few #defines any other symmetric cipher and hashing algorithm can be used,
if a personalized (and incompatible) version is desired.

This library is dual-licensed under the zlib license or GPL v2+ (see below).

If you use this code and like it, feel free to send me an email to
googlemail.com with false.genesis@ prepended.
- that'd make me happy.
Patches/improvements are welcome!

----------[ Howto ]------------

Build project/makefiles with CMake. It has sort of sane defaults so it should build
out of the box.

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

In the default configuration it comes with LZMA, LZF, and zlib as compression
backends, lvpak (the command line packer/unpacker),
and a test binary to verify that everything works.
In this configuration, the zlib license is applicable (see below).
You can additionally:
- enable LZO as additional compression backend
- build LVPA <-> ttvfs bindings 
- configure everything to link statically (if building on windows with MSVC)

This software is dual-licensed depending on the included external
libraries, which have the following licenses:

LZF  - BSD license (2-clause) or GPL v2+
LZMA - public domain
zlib - zlib license
LZO  - GPL v2+
Mersenne Twister random number generator - BSD license (3-clause)

If no support for LZO is included, this library is licensed under the
zlib license.
Otherwise, LZO support makes the zlib license inapplicable, in this case
this library is licensed under the GPL v2+.

Specifically, the dual-licensing applies to all files that do not have
an explicit copyright/license boilerplate, in the following subdirectories:

include, lvpa, lvpa_ttvfs, lvpak, tests
